GPS based granular audio playback system

How does it work?

A GPS antenna looks for signal from satellites to designate a location. When a location has been found the software uses this location to control a set of parameters to play back a sound using granular synthesis. 
There are two knobs and a button. The knobs control pitch and volume, and the button plays the sound according to the parameters dictated by the listener's location.
The system is battery powered, as it necessarily needs to be outside to function.
